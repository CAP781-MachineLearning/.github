### **Course Instructor: Tanzeela Javid Kaloo | Assistant Professor-LPU**

### **Course Summary**  

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **Machine Learning (ML)** and its applications, blending theoretical foundations with practical implementations. It explores core concepts, algorithms, and methodologies that form the basis of modern machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

The course is divided into six key units:  

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning**  
   - Understand the history, key definitions, and learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning).  
   - Explore the diverse applications of ML across industries.  

2. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Learn regression and classification techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-NN, SVM, decision trees, and ensemble methods.  
   - Delve into model evaluation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.  

3. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Study clustering methods, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, anomaly detection, and feature learning with autoencoders.  
   - Apply these techniques through case studies.  

4. **Image Processing**  
   - Gain foundational knowledge of digital image processing.  
   - Explore enhancement techniques, segmentation, feature extraction, and applications in computer vision.  

5. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**  
   - Understand neural network architectures, including MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs.  
   - Learn advanced topics such as transfer learning and pre-trained models for practical problem-solving.  

6. **Advanced Topics in Machine Learning**  
   - Discover emerging topics like reinforcement learning, deep Q-networks (DQNs), model compression, and optimization.  
   - Explore recent advances, future trends, and challenges in the field of machine learning.  

Throughout the course, students will apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on projects using Python and popular libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.). The course emphasizes both mathematical rigor and practical skill development, preparing students for real-world ML applications and research.  

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of machine learning principles, practical experience in implementing ML models, and insight into the future directions of AI technologies.
